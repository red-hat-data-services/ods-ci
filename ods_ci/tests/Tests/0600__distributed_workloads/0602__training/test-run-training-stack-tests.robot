## Note : For the disconnected environment, the KFTO Pytorch multi-node tests added below needs additional temporary workaround as a pre-requisite mentioned here
## Pre-requisite for disconnected : Update Kubeflow training operator deployment yaml to add additional arg in spec.containers.args : `--pytorch-init-container-image=quay.io/quay/busybox@sha256:92f3298bf80a1ba949140d77987f5de081f010337880cd771f7e7fc928f8c74d`
