*** Test Cases ***
Validate Service Mesh State Managed
    [Documentation]    The purpose of this Test Case is to validate Service Mesh integration
    [Tags]    Operator    Tier1    ODS-2526    ServiceMesh-Managed

    Is Resource Present    ServiceMeshControlPlane    ${SERVICE_MESH_CR_NAME}    ${SERVICE_MESH_CR_NS}    ${IS_PRESENT}
    Check If Pod Exists    ${SERVICE_MESH_CR_NS}    app=istiod    ${FALSE}

Validate Service Mesh State Unmanaged
    [Documentation]    The purpose of this Test Case is to validate Service Mesh state 'Unmanaged'.
    ...                The operator will not recreate/update the Service Mesh CR if removed or changed.
    [Tags]    Operator    Tier1    ODS-2526    ServiceMesh-Unmanaged

    Set Service Mesh Management State    Unmanaged    ${OPERATOR_NS}
    Delete Service Mesh Control Plane    ${SERVICE_MESH_CR_NS}

    ...    Is Resource Present    ServiceMeshControlPlane    ${SERVICE_MESH_CR_NAME}     ${SERVICE_MESH_CR_NS}    ${IS_NOT_PRESENT}

    [Teardown]    Set Service Mesh State To Managed And Wait For CR Ready    ${SERVICE_MESH_CR_NAME}    ${SERVICE_MESH_CR_NS}    ${OPERATOR_NS}

Validate Service Mesh State Removed
    [Documentation]    The purpose of this Test Case is to validate Service Mesh state 'Removed'.
    ...                The operator will Delete the Service Mesh CR, when state is Removed.
    ...                Test will fail until RHOAIENG-2209 is fixed
    [Tags]    ServiceMesh-Removed

    Set Service Mesh Management State    Removed    ${OPERATOR_NS}
