*** Test Cases ***
Validate DSC and DSCI Created Without Service Mesh And Serverless Operators     #robocop:disable
    [Documentation]    The purpose of this Test Case is to validate that DSC and DSCI are created
    ...                without dependant operators ((servicemesh, serverless) installed, but with errors
    [Tags]    Operator    Sanity    Tier1    ODS-2527
